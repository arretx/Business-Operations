## QSC [Rave 522ua](https://github.com/NewValleyChurch/Infrastructure-docs/blob/master/Worship-Ministries/Sound/Audio%20Hardware/DSP-Wiring-Diagram.md) Digital Signal Processor Wiring Diagram

The [Rave 522ua](https://github.com/NewValleyChurch/Infrastructure-docs/blob/master/Worship-Ministries/Sound/Audio%20Hardware/DSP-Wiring-Diagram.md) is a rack mounted digital audio router and signal processor.  Every bit of audio that we produce at New Valley passes through this box and is sent to one of many locations.

There are currently 3 inputs and 6 outputs being utilized.

### Inputs and Sources

- Input 1: Receives all main mix faders from the Main L output.
- Input 2: Receives all main mix faders from the Main R output.
- Input 5: Receives all Mix 4 output.

- Input 3, 4, 6, 7, & 8 are not connected.

### Outputs and Destinations

- Output 1: Stage Left Subwoofer
- Output 2: Stage Right Subwoofer
- Output 3: Stage Left Mains
- Output 5: Center Mains
- Output 6: 70V Amp Channel 1, Foyer.
- Output 7: Stage Right Mains

### Network Connection

- QSControl:  Standard RJ45 Ethernet port connected to the network switch.  Can be accessed using QSControl.net software on a Windows based computer only.

(Note:  The RAVE is a signal processor as well as a router.  It's the first place the audio signal is pre-processed with custom EQ before it reaches the QU-32.  It is also where the signal is crossed over to send the appropriate frequency ranges to the active speakers.)
