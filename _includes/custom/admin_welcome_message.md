## About the Author

Greetings!  My name is Jon Griffith and I am the one behind setting up this entire project.  As one of the original members of the congregation at New Valley, I have always been involved in some way, shape, or form in either the technical aspects of the church, or the worship music.  


As a result of our recent move to Chandler, we have graduated from the "temporary" environment that we had grown accustomed, to the beautiful facility we now have.  With that move has come new challenges and a higher level of excellence.  Alongside that come higher expectations, which means needing better organization and collaboration.


This all started with a few suggestions I had for updating the software we use for managing people, both congregation and staff, and to help take some of the weight off of the administrator, who was preparing to get married.  


Through that process, and through the move from the old building to Comstock, I found myself diving into projects that needed attention under a tight deadline.  Some of the projects have been brewing in my mind for years, but our previous location did not allow for them to come to fruition.


Keeping notes and tracking problems has been a challenge.  That is why I put together this little online universe that you've stumbled upon.  


The ultimate goal is clearly to be an Authentic Community where we can grow in the gospel.  I strive to do this with excellence through various tools, most of which are completely free.


So, I invite you to join in, participate, and collaborate with me to not only learn new ways to manage day to day expectations, but to grow as a team and achieve the goals that we've been commissioned by God to achieve.
