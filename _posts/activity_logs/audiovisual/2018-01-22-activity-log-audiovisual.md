- Identified that the Stage Display in the back of the Sanctuary had no power due to a tripped breaker (breaker #17) on the Foyer panel. Turned power on.
- Programmed Harmony Remote Control to be able to access the Vizio stage monitor on the back of the sanctuary wall. Tested, success.
- Connected TV to WIFI Network.
- Named the TV.
- Installed J5Create USB to HDMI adapter on iMac.  Initially had a problem with the driver included with the product and the downloaded driver was a viable replacement.
- Discovered the Balun receiver on the Stage Display was inactive and would not power up.
- Was unsuccessful in connecting the iMac to the Stage Display (Vizio) most likely due to the limitations of the adapter.
