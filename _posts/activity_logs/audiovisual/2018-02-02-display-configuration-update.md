Sadly, after extensive troubleshooting with 2 different adapters and various video drivers, adding a 4th display to the iMac was unsuccessful.  The vision is to have a stage display feed coming out of the iMac that can essentially be fed to any location in the building, which would include the rear display in the sanctuary, and potentially, with HDMI splitters, displays on the stage, or another video input that could stream the feed via mobile devices so we have it in front of us just about anywhere we want it.

**Current Limitations:**

- iMac is an older version, 2011, with only a single Thunderbolt port and USB 2.0.
- USB to HDMI may not be possible alongside the DualHead2Go in this older environment.  My tests have proven that this is in all likelihood true.

Until we solve the problem of the limitations of the iMac that we currently use, we won't have this in place.  There are a few additional configurations that I can test and will keep you posted on what I find.
