One of the exciting aspects of using Ableton Live in a house of worship is the ability to network two or more computers both running Ableton Live together in a Master/Slave environment, where one computer can:

- Take-over clock control of the slave computer and trigger the timeline.
- Remotely control MIDI CC values without interrupting the clock on the slave computer.

What does this look like?

With some time and configuration, all of the DMX lighting can be remotely controlled and complete synchronization of the audio, lights, and media elements in a given Sunday morning service can be on point and synchronized with the music to any degree we choose.

Imagine the band starting the prelude on a Sunday morning and having it run an automation clip that set the stage lights and the house lights to a specific level.

Consistency.  Experience.  Effortless.  

Pretty cool what we will be able to do.  The canvas we have is much larger than our current supply of paint, so...one step at a time.
