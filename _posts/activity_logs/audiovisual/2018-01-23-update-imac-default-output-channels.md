After service this past Sunday, the Mexico Missions trip meeting moved into the sanctuary due to attendance.

As a result, we needed to fire up the sound system again, and setup a quick recording track to capture the meeting.

By default, when the iMac is powered up, if there are no pre-configured audio devices connected to the system (i.e. the sound board is off), the speaker outputs in the Audio MIDI Setup on the iMac tend to find their way back to Left 1 and Right 2.

Our current configuration on the mixer places the input from the iMac on channel strip 23 and 24.

When we select the audio device for the iMac, often we have to also go into the output setting for that device and switch the speaker outputs. This, to date, has been the one setting that is most often forgotten.

I propose that we make a change to the setup to eliminate the need for this step. If we bring the audio from the iMac in on channels 1 and 2, despite any given connection status, the iMac will always be defaulted to those two channels, and there will never be a risk of not having the L/R system sound from the iMac properly routed to the QU-32.
