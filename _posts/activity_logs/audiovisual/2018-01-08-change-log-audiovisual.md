- Wired a new XLR connection from the QU-32 Mix 4 Output to input 5 of the RAVE 522ua DSP.
- Isolated output 6 on the DSP (Foyer Mix)
- Mapped out a [Wiring Diagram](https://github.com/NewValleyChurch/Infrastructure-docs/blob/master/Worship-Ministries/Sound/Audio%20Hardware/DSP-Wiring-Diagram.md#wiring-diagram) for the Rave 522ua.
- Anything sent to Mix 4 goes only to the Foyer and Kitchen area.
- Discovered that the overheads on the 70V amp are all on a single zone.  There's no current way to isolate multiple zones outside of the sanctuary without re-wiring the zones.
- Tested the volume control in the cry room.  It works.
