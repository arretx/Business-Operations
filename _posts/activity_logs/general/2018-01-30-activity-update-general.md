Migration of the site from the GitHub WIKI has been a much more time intensive project than originally planned as there's a fairly steep learning curve regarding the platform that the site is operating on.  But, it's getting there.

Today the majority of the changes included re-writing the code in the XML feeds, creating groups in Mailchimp, and developing an automated RSS template for each volunteer team so they could be notified of updates such as this one.

Menus are coming together but there is still quite a bit of information to push through to the navigation structure.  Onward!
