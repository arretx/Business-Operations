# What this is...

The two files here were written by Amit Agarwal sometime in 2014.  (https://ctrlq.org/) Together, when deployed, this script sends an e-mail to everyone in your Google Contacts with a specific group designation (which you define) with a message and a link encouraging them to update their contact information through a form.

It works well, but it's missing a few features that would improve it.

1.  When the form opens, the fields that exist with data in Google Contacts should pre-populate so the user sees the information that is already on hand so they can verify it.

2.  A drop down select list that offers a few options like "Everything looks good..." and "I updated a few fields...", etc. would be great.

3.  Once the contact is updated by the user, there needs to be a way for me to know that they updated it.  I don't necessarily need to have an e-mail sent every time, but if I did, it would be something like:

Hey, XXXX just updated their contact information in your Google Contacts.  Click here to thank them...etc.

-or-

If when they update their contact information, they are added to a group such as "User Updated on {date}" then I could just list those people, and then create a segment on Mailchimp to thank them.
