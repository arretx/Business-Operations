### Power Up

Best case scenario - order of operations.

- iMac On
- QU-32 On
- Ableton Live Up
- Ableton Live NV Default Setup set loaded[^1]
- House Lights / Stage Lights Up[^2]
- Projectors On [(Use Web Interface)](https://github.com/NewValleyChurch/Infrastructure/wiki/Projectors)
- Pro-Presenter Up
- Calibration Slide Up
- Projectors Calibrated
- Background Up w/NV logo prop

Footnotes:

[^1]: When Ableton Live loads, a new untitled set is created automatically using the default template (set in preferences.)  This is not the set we use when we go live.  From Ableton's file browser, double-click **NV Default Setup**.  This loads not only the correct configuration, but all of the previous references to Sermons, etc.  

[^2]: DMXIS will only operate from a single instance and needs to be loaded _**by Ableton Live**_.  If the Media computer is already on when you arrive, make sure that DMXIS is **NOT** already running.  If it is, shut it down _**before loading Ableton Live**_. Ableton Live loads the DMXIS software as a plug-in which gives us smooth dimming control over the lights _and_ connects the lighting system to manual faders (currently mapped to the QU-32 Custom Layer)
