## Pre-requisites:

- QU-32 Mixer must be on.
- iMac must be powered up.
- iMac must be connected to the QU-32 via USB.

{% include note.html content="All Mac products ship with built in sound, usually consisting of a microphone and a speaker.  This is the default system sound setting if no other options are available.  The QU-32 is recognized by OSX as a sound processing device and the iMac needs to be set to use this as the sound device." %}

## Steps:

1.  On the keyboard, press and hold Option, then click the volume speaker in the status bar at the top of the iMac screen.  Ensure that both input and output are set to the QU-32.  If you don't see the QU-32 as an option, check the prerequisites at the top of this document.
2.  Verify the output settings on the iMac.  Press OPTION-SPACE to invoke Alfred.  Type Audio and then launch the Audio MIDI Setup, which should be the first item in the list.
3.  You may see nothing happen.  That's okay.  If so, press and hold Command, then tap the '1' key.
4.  In the Audio Devices window, you'll see the QU-32 on the list of items on the left.  You can confirm the device's connection by noting where the microphone and speaker icons are in this list.  If they're both on the QU-32, then step 1 of this process was a success.  In the right pane, there are two tabs.  One for Input, one for Output.
5.  Click the Output Tab.
6.  Confirm that the speaker left is set to 23, and speaker right is set to 24.  Often they re-set themselves to 1 and 2.
