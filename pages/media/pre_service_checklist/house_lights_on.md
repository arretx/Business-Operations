## Steps:

{% include note.html content="On most occasions, by the time you arrive the lights will already be on and the sound will already be active.  Continue to checklist step 2 if that is the case." %}

1. Turn on and login to the iMac.
2. Launch Ableton Live
3. Make sure you're in session view.  Session view looks like a spreadsheet with colored column headers.  If you are not in session view, press TAB on the keyboard to switch, or click the icon in the upper right corner with the three vertical lines.
4. Locate the lighting group and the track labeled DMXIS.
5. Click the play button on the first clip in the column.  It is labeled "House INSTANT ALL ON" and is located in Scene 1 (which is the same as row 1.)  The lights should come on.
