## Basics

The NV Media team provides all of the visual elements in the Sanctuary as well as audio and video published for various content platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Podcasts, and content for the hearing impaired.

Our tools are industry standard tools running on a Mac OSX platform.  They currently include:

- ProPresenter 6: For control over visual projections.
- Ableton Live 9: Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) for Multi-Track recording and MIDI control of various hardware devices.
- DMXIS: DMX Lighting Control for house and stage lighting.

## Pre-Service Checklist

There is a pre-service checklist that will guide you through the steps you need to take to accomplish the successful delivery of media and recording of sermons through the course of any service or event.  Please refer to that every week as it _is_ a dynamic list and may change from time to time.
