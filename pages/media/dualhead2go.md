## 2nd Display Review

Most computers now come with the ability to extend the desktop to a 2nd display.  Nearly all laptops have this capability as they have a built in screen _and_ a port for an additional monitor.

The iMac is no different.  

But, what happens when we need to connect more than one display?

## DualHead2Go

That is the case for New Valley.  We currently have 3 displays configured and connected, and we actually need to be able to connect 4.

- Display 1: The iMac main screen.
- Display 2: Projector 1, stage right.
- Display 3: Projector 2, stage left.

Using a device called the DualHead2Go, we are able to split the signal from the thunderbolt port and send duplicate desktops from the iMac to the projectors.

The DualHead2Go is mounted under the counter-top near the iMac.

With the added software, we are able to trick the iMac into thinking that displays 2 and 3 are actually ONE display.  So, from the iMac's video display setting's perspective, there are really only "two displays."

We have display 1, which is the built in monitor.  And we have display 2 which is a combination of the actual #2 and #3 displays, which is the 3600X1200 configuration.
