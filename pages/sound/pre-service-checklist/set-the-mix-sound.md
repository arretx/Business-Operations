## Steps:

This is where your skills as an audio engineer are put to the test.  Do your best to mix the sound and adjust the EQ to the best of your ability for the service's arrangements.

Be prepared for the unknown.  Have a plan in your mind to handle anything that may come up that could adversely affect the flow of the service or distract the congregation.
