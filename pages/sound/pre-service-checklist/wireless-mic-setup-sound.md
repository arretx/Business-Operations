## Steps:

1.  Ensure that all wireless transmitters have a fresh battery.
2.  Cycle through each wireless mic, testing for a signal.
3.  Put the hand-held near the apron of the stage for announcements and special guests.
4.  Equip the pastor(s) with their transmitter packs.
5.  Have each presenter test their mics and test the hand-held, preferably with the person who will be using it, if available.  Also coach them on how to hold the mic to make your job easier.
6.  Ensure that all wireless mics are muted prior to service and that the handheld is ON.  Use your judgment here regarding the hand-held.  It's always nicer when someone can just pick up the mic and use it without having to tap it and ask if it's on.
