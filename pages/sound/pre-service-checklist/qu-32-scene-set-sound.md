## Steps:

### 1. Copy Scene

{% include callout.html content="**Best Practice:** Scenes save time.  We have a base scene entitled 'NV Base Scene' which is a starting point for every event that we do that utilizes our basic setup.  To preserve its settings, we copy it to another slot, then we mix for the service or event." %}

1. On the QU-32, press the Scene button to the right of the display.
2. Tap the Copy button.
3. Tap the NV Base Scene.
4. Tap the Paste button.
5. Tap the scene slot you wish to copy to.
6. Tap the scene you just copied, recall it, and confirm.
7. Rename the scene to the date of the current or pending service or event.  By doing this, we'll know which scene to recall if there's a period of time between now (such as a rehearsal) and the actual service.  We'll also know when a scene can be overwritten as it will be outdated.

Now you're working with a fresh copy of the NV Base Scene without the risk of changing the original.  This is also a good way to test new ideas and settings for a given scene which can be incrementally saved to the actual original as the changes are adopted.
