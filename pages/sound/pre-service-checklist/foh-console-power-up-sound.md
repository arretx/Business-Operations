{% include important.html content="The order of operations when power cycling the components at FOH is critical to maintaining and protecting the equipment.  Power applied in the wrong order can lead to damage to equipment, and hearing loss." %}

{% include note.html content="We currently have no way to shut down the active mains and sub-woofers.  A plan is in place to solve this problem in the future to prevent audio spikes to the mains." %}

1. Turn on all wireless microphone receivers.
