## Understanding How Ableton Live Manages Files

When you record audio in Ableton Live, a clip is created either in the Arrangement View timeline, or in a Session View clip slot.

Clips are simply _**placeholders**_ for the underlying audio file that is created.

Every time we press record, an underlying *.aif* audio file (based upon Live -> Preferences) is created in a folder that is tied directly to the current SET that you are working in.

If we work inside of an Untitled set, all audio recorded prior to saving that set is stored in a temporary folder.  Over time, temporary folders stack up and create a trail of audio files with no clear organization.

This is why it's important to use the NV Default Setup set (NV Default Setup.als) every time we record.
