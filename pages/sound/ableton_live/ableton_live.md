## Basics

Ableton Live is a very powerful <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.DAW}}">DAW</a> that we currently use for two purposes:

1. Record and store Sermons during services.
2. Automate and control DMX lighting through the DMXIS control module.

It records both audio and MIDI data and is a powerful automation and arrangement tool.

{% include callout.html content="The direction we can move with Ableton Live will empower us to do more with less hands.  Between multiple computers running Ableton Live, synchronized via MIDI networking, we can integrate automations into the entire worship experience to not only power the actual worship songs, but also to control lighting, audio effects, and video.  <br/><br/>**Example:** At the start of any given service, we typically have some sort of background music rolling for ambience.  In the future, when the worship band triggers their first song, Ableton Live will be able to automatically fade out the house music, dim the lights, and make room for the band to provide a seamless and consistent experience every time." type="primary" %}
