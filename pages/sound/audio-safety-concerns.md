## In Ear Monitors

It's important to familiarize yourself with the potential hazards to the musicians when it comes to the in-ear monitor system.  We always want to prevent the loud popping that can be transmitted any time someone plugs their instrument in.  To ensure that the musicians are never at risk of this there are a few precautions you can take:

- Make sure that Mute Follow is ON for that particular channel.  This is more important on channels that are delivering a 48V power supply to the snake.
- Place a foot-pedal switching device like a tuner between the instrument and the dSnake.  (Mostly a guitar thing.)

Always keep the channel muted on the board until you have confirmed that the musician has plugged in.  Under no circumstance would we ever want to simply un-mute channels on the board just because they'll be used on that given day.  This only applies to feeds that are 48V powered, or for musicians who plug-in while their instrument is "live."
