# Vendors

There is currently one vendor that I know about that is exclusively all things stage and lighting.

[Barbizon Lighting Company](https://www.barbizon.com/office/Phoenix)

South of the Loop 202 in Tempe on the west side of Priest.

They carry hundreds of major brands of lighting and lighting equipment, stage equipment and supplies.

## Supplies

Gaff brand tape is approximately $1.00 per yard at 2" thick.  Channel tape, like the black tape with adhesive only on the outside edges, is about $2.50-$3.00/yard.

## DMX Lighting Definition Files

There's a great site that's a [crowd sourced repository](http://fixtures.dmxis.com/) of DMX lighting configuration files to be used inside of [DMXIS](https://github.com/NewValleyChurch/Infrastructure/wiki/About-DMXIS).
