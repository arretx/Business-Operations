# How to Control the Lights

The DMX lighting, which consists of the 7 banks of house lights, 7 Front of House LED spots, and 2 Electrics are all controlled by the [DMXIS](https://github.com/NewValleyChurch/Infrastructure/wiki/About-DMXIS) which is a combination of hardware and a software application that runs on the iMac.

There are 2 ways to control the lights.  Each method is used according to what's needed at the time.  I'll outline the first method here.

## Simple DMX Light Control from the QU-32 Custom Layer

- Make sure the QU-32 Mixer and the iMac are both on.
- Open Ableton Live on the iMac.  The default set that opens has the [DMXIS](https://github.com/NewValleyChurch/Infrastructure/wiki/About-DMXIS) plugin installed on one of the channels.
- Switch the QU-32 to the Custom Layer (two buttons just above and to the left of Channel Strip 1 slider control.)![Layers Buttons](https://github.com/NewValleyChurch/Infrastructure-docs/blob/master/images/QU%20Layer.jpg)  

- Use Fader Strip 1 to bring all house lights up.  Use Fader strip 2 and 3 to control the FOH and Electrics.
- It's important that you return to the main mix by pressing the bottom Layer button.  If you don't you'll remain on the custom layer and will not be able to control the L/R Mix.
