## Project Status

This site will perpetually evolve into a valuable resource over time.  It is currently in its early phases with a focus on developing resources that are closely related to technical departments including the A/V Teams (Sound, Staging & Lights, Audio) and the Information Technology infrastructure.

Future evolutions will include other resources from the various volunteer departments that we have but for now, one volunteer can only add so much.
